dzen_canard is a simple bash API to easily drive dzen2 scripts.

Didn't have time to write a good documentation, so use the source Luke. You
can also have a look to the example file.

usage
-----

Dzen Canard sets up a bunch of functions usefull to build some dzen2 command
line option and handle the main loop.

The Dzen Canard core scripts automatically sources all needed files, and then
call a user define bash script $HOME/.config/dzen-canard/canard.sh that will
used this function to call the main loop function 'run_loop' with appropriate
arguments.


configuration
-------------

Configuration files are loaded from /usr/local/etc/dzen-canard, then from
$HOME/.config/dzen-canard/config.sh (configuration can be overidden from
this last file).


library
-------

Library are bash scripts that contains functions used to display informaiton
on dzen2. A Dzen Canard library file must start with 'dzen_' in order to be
sourced by the core Dzen Canard script.

Some Dzen Canard Libraries are already written and located in 
/usr/local/lib/dzen_canard after installation. Custom function can be written
and put in $HOME/.config/dzen-canard/libs.


output formatters
-----------------

Output can be formatted used the run_loop --formatter argument. See the
provided example to see how it work.


icons
-----

Some icons are provided from the dzen2 package. They are located in
/usr/local/share/dzen_canard/icons.
Some user defined icons can be added or override existing ones in
$HOME/.config/dzen-canard/icons.

A bunch of icons are defined in the default configuration files.


installation
------------

Although Dzen Canard can run without being installed, you can install it by
running the setup.sh script. Some path in the script will be changed by a
bunch of 'sed' commands before being moved in appropriate directories.

Run the setup.sh script with 'uninstall' argument to remove Dzen Canard from
your system.
